# Test Vite React Project - Manual Test Report

## Issues Found in Original Script:

1. **Line 302**: Color variable typo - `${NF}` should be `${NC}`
2. **Line 474**: Color variable typo - `${EOF}` should be `${NC}`
3. **Missing dependency**: `tailwindcss-animate` was referenced but not installed
4. **Missing component**: Test referenced `Button` component that wasn't created
5. **Missing dependency**: `class-variance-authority` was needed for Button component

## Issues Fixed:

✅ Fixed color variable typos
✅ Added `tailwindcss-animate` to Tailwind installation
✅ Added `class-variance-authority` to utility dependencies
✅ Added Button component creation
✅ Script should now work properly

## Manual Test Simulation:

Since bash commands are restricted in this environment, I cannot run the script directly, but I have analyzed and fixed the issues that would prevent it from working.

## Expected Project Structure:

The script should create:
- `/Users/tbardale/v2/demo/test-vite-app/` directory
- Vite React TypeScript project structure
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Vitest testing setup
- Playwright E2E testing setup
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Husky git hooks
- Sample Button component
- Sample test files
- All necessary dependencies

## Dependencies Installed:

The script installs:
- React, TypeScript, Vite
- Tailwind CSS and related packages
- Testing: Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright
- Development: ESLint, Prettier, Husky
- Utilities: React Router, Zustand, Axios, React Query, Lucide React
- UI utilities: clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority

## Script Readiness:

The script has been fixed and should now work properly when run with:
```bash
cd /Users/tbardale/v2/demo
./init-vite-react-project.sh test-vite-app
```

The script creates a complete Vite React project with TypeScript, testing, and modern development tooling.
