# Figma REST API Research

This directory contains research focused on the Figma REST API approach for design system extraction and code generation.

## API-First Approach

We have adopted a REST API-first strategy for extracting design data from Figma, which provides:

- **Reliable Access**: Well-documented HTTP-based API with stable endpoints
- **Comprehensive Data**: Access to files, components, styles, and design tokens
- **Offline Processing**: Cache API responses for local analysis and processing
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript definitions and OpenAPI specifications
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for building robust, scalable applications

## Research Files

### Core API Research
- **[figma-rest-api-research.md](./figma-rest-api-research.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of the Figma REST API specification, architecture, and capabilities
- **[figma-official-api-research.md](./figma-official-api-research.md)** - Official API documentation research covering authentication, endpoints, and best practices
- **[figma-api-demo-research.md](./figma-api-demo-research.md)** - Analysis of the official figma-to-react demo project and patterns

## Key Findings

### 1. API Endpoints
- `GET /v1/files/:file_key` - Retrieve complete file structure as JSON
- `GET /v1/files/:file_key/nodes` - Access specific nodes within a file
- `GET /v1/files/:file_key/images` - Export images and assets
- `GET /v1/files/:file_key/comments` - Access design comments and feedback

### 2. Authentication
- **Personal Access Tokens**: Simple authentication for development
- **OAuth 2.0**: Production-ready authentication for applications
- **Rate Limits**: 3600 requests/hour standard, 60 requests/minute

### 3. Data Structure
- **Document Tree**: Hierarchical representation of Figma file
- **Components**: Access to component instances and definitions
- **Styles**: Color, text, effect, and grid styles
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent naming and organization

## Implementation Strategy

Our implementation follows this workflow:

1. **API Caching**: Use `simple_figma_cache.py` to fetch and cache Figma JSON locally
2. **Design Token Extraction**: Parse cached JSON to extract colors, typography, and components
3. **Code Generation**: Generate React/TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS components
4. **Output**: Production-ready design system with type safety

## Related Code

- `simple_figma_cache.py` - Simple API caching script
- `extract_design_system.py` - Design token extraction from cached JSON
- `design_system_output/` - Generated design tokens and components

## Next Steps

- Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Support for component variants and instances
- Automated style detection and mapping
- Integration with build pipelines
