# Figma to Code: Automated Design System Extraction

🚨 **Status**: Planning & Architecture Phase
📁 **Repository**: [github.com/iamplus-trimabk/figma-to-code](https://github.com/iamplus-trimabk/figma-to-code)

## Overview

This project automates the extraction of design systems and component libraries from Figma designs using Playwright MCP and AI-powered analysis. It transforms static Figma screens into production-ready React components with comprehensive documentation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Automated Figma Navigation**: Systematically traverse all screens using Playwright MCP
- **Design Token Extraction**: Automatically extract colors, typography, spacing, and components
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify reusable components across multiple screens
- **Component Generation**: Create production-ready React/TypeScript components
- **Visual Validation**: Ensure generated components match original designs
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Auto-generated component docs with examples

## 📋 Project Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Discovery (Week 1)
- [ ] Configure Playwright MCP for Figma automation
- [ ] Document Figma interface elements and selectors
- [ ] Create screen capture utilities
- [ ] Establish authentication workflows

### Phase 2: Screen Documentation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Automate navigation through all Figma screens
- [ ] Capture screenshots and extract design metadata
- [ ] Generate structured JSON/MD design tokens
- [ ] Create comprehensive screen documentation

### Phase 3: Component Analysis (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Analyze design tokens for common patterns
- [ ] Identify and catalog reusable components
- [ ] Create component hierarchy and relationships
- [ ] Document component variants and states

### Phase 4: Implementation (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Generate React component implementations
- [ ] Create component documentation and examples
- [ ] Validate against original Figma designs
- [ ] Establish component library maintenance
