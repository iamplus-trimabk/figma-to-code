# Evolutionary Development Guidelines (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## üö® CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY: Evolutionary Development

This project follows EMERGENT EVOLUTION principles - we will NEVER plan stories, tasks, PRDs, or architecture in one go. Everything evolves as we make progress.

### Core Principles (MANDATORY for all agents):
- **Small batches only**: 2-3 tasks maximum at any time
- **No big-upfront planning**: Never plan comprehensively
- **Emergent design**: Architecture and requirements emerge naturally
- **Just-in-time planning**: Plan only for immediate next steps
- **Feedback-driven iteration**: Each step informs the next
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

### Telescope and Compass Mode
All agents must operate as "telescope and compass":
- **Telescope**: Focus on next step only (2-3 tasks maximum)
- **Compass**: Warn if wrong direction, help foresee near future
- **Horizon**: Never plan beyond immediate iteration
- **Guidance**: Provide direction, not comprehensive roadmap

### Agent Responsibilities
1. **Current Iteration Focus**: Only work on immediate 2-3 tasks
2. **Wrong Direction Warnings**: Alert if approach violates evolutionary principles
3. **Near Future Foresight**: Help anticipate 1-2 steps ahead, not long-term
4. **Emergent Design Support**: Let architecture evolve from implementation
5. **Feedback Collection**: Use discoveries to inform next steps

### Prohibited Agent Behaviors
- ‚ùå Comprehensive upfront planning
- ‚ùå Long-term roadmaps and timelines
- ‚ùå Detailed architecture specifications
- ‚ùå Large task batches (more than 3)
- ‚ùå Predictive commitments beyond next iteration
- ‚ùå Big design upfront (BDUF)

## Working Approach (REQUIRED)

### Task Selection Process
1. **Assess Current State**: What's working, what needs improvement
2. **Choose 2-3 Tasks**: Pick concrete, achievable tasks
3. **Implement and Learn**: Build, test, gather feedback
4. **Discover Next Steps**: Let findings inform next iteration
5. **Repeat Cycle**: Continue evolutionary process

### Documentation Approach
- **Minimal Documentation**: Only what's needed for current work
- **Emergent Specs**: Let specifications evolve from implementation
- **Living Documents**: Update based on discoveries, not predictions
- **Context Over Comprehensiveness**: Focus on immediate needs

### Quality Assurance
- **Evolutionary Testing**: Test what's built, not what's planned
- **Feedback-Driven Quality**: Let usage inform improvements
- **Adaptive Standards**: Evolve standards based on experience
- **Practical Excellence**: Focus on working solutions

## Communication Guidelines

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- **Current Context Only**: Share immediate task status
- **Discovery Sharing**: Exchange learnings from current work
- **Warning System**: Alert about evolutionary principle violations
- **Next Step Coordination**: Align on immediate next tasks

### User Communication
- **Transparency**: Be clear about evolutionary approach
- **Progress Focus**: Highlight what's working now
- **Discovery Emphasis**: Share learnings from implementation
- **Next Step Clarity**: Always know what's immediate next

## Success Metrics

### Evolutionary Health Indicators
- ‚úÖ Small batch sizes (2-3 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Working software delivered frequently
- ‚úÖ Architecture emerging naturally
- ‚úÖ Discoveries informing next steps
- ‚úÖ Minimal documentation overhead

### Warning Signs
- ‚ùå Comprehensive planning sessions
- ‚ùå Large task backlogs
- ‚ùå Predictive long-term commitments
- ‚ùå Architecture without implementation
- ‚ùå Documentation without working software

## Emergency Procedures

### If Agent Violates Evolutionary Principles
1. **Immediate Correction**: Stop comprehensive planning
2. **Return to Small Batches**: Reduce to 2-3 tasks maximum
3. **Focus on Working Software**: Implement concrete solutions
4. **Learn and Adapt**: Use experience to guide next steps
5. **Reset Expectations**: Communicate evolutionary approach

### If User Requests Comprehensive Planning
1. **Educate**: Explain evolutionary philosophy benefits
2. **Redirect**: Focus on immediate 2-3 tasks
3. **Demonstrate**: Show working software from evolutionary approach
4. **Persist**: Maintain evolutionary principles as non-negotiable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-NEGOTIABLE WARNING

Any agent or workflow that violates these evolutionary principles will be immediately corrected. This philosophy is the foundation of our development approach and applies to ALL work in this project.

**Remember**: We build software, not plans. We discover architecture, we don't design it upfront. We evolve requirements, we don't predict them.
