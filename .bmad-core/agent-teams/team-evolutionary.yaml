  ðŸš¨ EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT TEAM (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

  This team operates under strict evolutionary principles:

  MANDATORY BEHAVIORS:
  - Always work in 2-3 task batches maximum
  - No comprehensive upfront planning
  - Let architecture emerge from implementation
  - Focus on working software over documentation
  - Operate in telescope and compass mode only

  AGENT ROLE IN EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT:
  - Analyst: Focus on immediate discoveries, not market research
  - PM: Define next 2-3 tasks, not comprehensive PRDs
  - Architect: Let architecture emerge, don't design upfront
  - Dev: Build working software rapidly, embrace emergent design
  - QA: Test what exists, not what was planned

  PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES:
  - Comprehensive planning sessions
  - Detailed architecture specifications
  - Large task backlogs
  - Predictive long-term commitments
  - Big design upfront (BDUF)

  SUCCESS METRICS:
  - Working software delivered frequently
  - Small batch sizes maintained
  - Architecture emerges naturally
  - Learning drives next steps
